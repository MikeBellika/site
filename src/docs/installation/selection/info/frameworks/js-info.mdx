The JavaScript option works with any framework and allows constructing the player and layouts
imperatively like so:

```ts
VidstackPlayer.create({
  target: '#player',
  src: '...',
  layout: new VidstackPlayerLayout(),
});
```

You can target an existing audio, video, or iframe element to progressively enhance it.
