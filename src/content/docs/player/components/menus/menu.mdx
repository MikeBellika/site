## Height Transition

The `--menu-height` CSS variable is exposed to enable creating smooth height transitions. The
`data-transition="height"` attribute will be present when the transition is active:

::code[./height]

## Submenus

Submenus can be easily created by nesting menus like so:

::code[./submenu]

::code[./submenu-styles]
