description: A guide on how to setup the Plyr audio/video layout and available customization options.
---

import MediaPlayer from '~/components/players/lazy-media-player.svelte';

:::tip
Try out the Plyr Layout on our [player demo](/player/demo?layout=plyr&framework=react) page.
:::

The Plyr Layout ships with support for audio, video, and live streams:

::code[./usage]

By default, the view type is inferred from the provider and media type. You can specify the desired
type like so:

::code[./view-type]

The same is true for the [stream type][stream-type]:

::code[./stream-type]

[stream-type]: /docs/player/core-concepts/loading#stream-type

## Icons

You can easily replace the icons used in the layout to match the style of your application like
so:

::code[./icons]{copy=true}

::code[./provide-icons]

## Thumbnails

You can provide thumbnails which will be used to display preview images when interacting with
the time slider and scrubbing. See the [loading thumbnails][loading-thumbnails] guide
for more information.

::code[./thumbnails]

[loading-thumbnails]: /docs/player/core-concepts/loading#thumbnails

## Language

The layout supports internationalization (i18n) by accepting custom language
translations. You can dynamically set the `translations` property to update the language like so:

::code[./language]{copy=true}
::code[./provide-language]

## CSS Variables

The following snippet contains a complete list of CSS variables and their respective default values.
They can all be adjusted by you to customize the layout as desired.

::code[./layout-vars]{copy=true}

## Slots

The `slots` prop can be used to insert or replace content inside the `PlyrLayout`. You can
find all available [slot positions](#positions) below.

::code[./slots]{copy=true}

### Positions

The following slot positions are available for inserting or replacing content:

- airPlayButton
- captionsButton
- currentTime
- download
- duration
- fastForwardButton
- fullscreenButton
- liveButton
- muteButton
- pipButton
- playButton
- playLargeButton
- poster
- restartButton
- rewindButton
- settings
- settingsButton
- timeSlider
- volumeSlider
- settingsMenu

:::info
Any slot position can be prefixed with either `before` or `after` to insert content before or
after that position. For example, `afterCaptionButton` will insert content after the caption
button.
