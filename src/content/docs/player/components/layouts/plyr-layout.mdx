description: A guide on how to setup the Plyr audio/video layout and available customization options.
---

## Installation

See the [installation guide][install] to setup the Plyr Layout.

[install]: /docs/player/getting-started/installation?styling=plyr-layout&provider=video

## Demo

You can try out the Plyr Layout on our [player demo](/player/demo?layout=plyr&framework=wc) page.

## Usage

The Plyr Layout ships with support for audio, video, and live streams:

::code[./usage]

By default, the view type is inferred from the provider and media type. You can specify the desired
type like so:

::code[./view-type]

The same is true for the [stream type][stream-type]:

::code[./stream-type]

[stream-type]: /docs/player/core-concepts/loading#stream-type

### JavaScript

import StyleImports from '~/docs/installation/partials/import-styles-snippet.svelte';
import JSPlayerCode from '~/docs/installation/partials/js-player-snippet.svelte';

You can setup the player using JavaScript like so:

<StyleImports type="plyr-layout" client:load />

<JSPlayerCode type="plyr-layout" client:load />

The `target` config option is a target element which can be a CSS string selector or a `HTMLElement`.
The target can be any element but if it's a `<audio>`, `<video>`, or `<iframe>` element it will be
replaced and enhanced (i.e., progressive enhancement).

### Compat

If you're coming over from [Plyr][plyr] and want a softer migration path, you can consider using our
Plyr constructor which has about ~95% of the same features and API:

<StyleImports type="plyr-layout" client:load />

<JSPlayerCode plyr type="plyr-layout" client:load />

See the Plyr GitHub repo for docs and usage. Do note, in general this API is more limited and
doesn't have easy access to all player features. We strongly recommend upgrading to the newer API
above.

## Icons

You can easily replace the icons used in the layout to match the style of your application like
so:

::code[./icons]{copy=true}

::code[./provide-icons]

## Thumbnails

You can provide thumbnails which will be used to display preview images when interacting with
the time slider and scrubbing. See the [loading thumbnails][loading-thumbnails] guide
for more information.

::code[./thumbnails]

[loading-thumbnails]: /docs/player/core-concepts/loading#thumbnails

## Language

The layout supports internationalization (i18n) by accepting custom language
translations. You can dynamically set the `translations` property to update the language like so:

::code[./language]{copy=true}
::code[./provide-language]

## CSS Variables

The following snippet contains a complete list of CSS variables and their respective default values.
They can all be adjusted by you to customize the layout as desired.

::code[./layout-vars]{copy=true}
