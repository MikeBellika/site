:::info
Audio tracks are currently supported by the [HLS Provider][hls-provider] and [Dash Provider][dash-provider].
They can not be added programatically.

[dash-provider]: /docs/player/api/providers/dash

## Tracks List

The read-only `audioTracks` property on the player returns an `AudioTrackList` object that
contains `AudioTrack` objects

Similar to text tracks, the returned list is live; that is, as tracks are added to and
removed from the player, the list's contents change dynamically. Once you have a reference to
the list, you can monitor it for changes to detect when new tracks are added or existing ones
are removed by [listening to list events](#list-events).

::code[./tracks-list]

The `AudioTrack` interface contains the following shape:

::code[./audio-track]

### Selecting

The `selected` property can be used to set the current audio track like so:

::code[./select]

Once set, the underlying provider will update the audio track.

### List Events

The `AudioTrackList` object is an [`EventTarget`][event-target] which dispatches the following events:

- `add`: Fired when an audio track has been added to the list.
- `remove`: Fired when an audio track has been removed from the list.
- `change`: Fired when the selected audio track changes.

::code[./list-events]

## Media State

The following audio track related properties are available on the media store:

- `audioTracks`: An array containing the current list of AudioTrack objects.
- `audioTrack`: The current AudioTrack object or null if none is available.

::code[./state]

If you're using React check out the [`useAudioOptions`][use-audio-options] hook for building menus.

## Remote Control

`media-audio-track-change-request` request events to update the current audio track like so:

::code[./remote]
