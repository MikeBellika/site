## Requesting

The player supports playing on a remote device such as a TV when [AirPlay][airplay] or
[Google Cast][google-cast] are available. You can request remote playback by using the
[`AirPlayButton`][airplay-button], [`GoogleCastButton`][google-cast-button],
[remote control](#remote-control) or via [methods](#methods) on the player instance.

### Process

The entire remote playback request process is async and lazy loaded to avoid bloating the
player library and your application:

1. The Google Cast framework is lazy loaded only on request.
2. Once the framework is loaded, the cast prompt is shown.
3. When a cast receiver device is selected by the user, the [`GoogleCastProvider`][google-cast-provider] is
   lazy loaded and switched with current provider. The remote cast player is set to the correct
   state with respect to paused, time, muted, captions, etc. A provider change and setup event is
   fired in this process.
4. When the casting session ends, the `GoogleCastProvider` is destroyed.
5. The previous provider is created and set back to its original state. A provider change and
   setup event is fired in this process.

:::info
AirPlay does not require loading any framework as it's supported directly on the `<audio>` and
`<video>` element via the [Remote Playback API][remote-playback-api].
