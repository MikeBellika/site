title: HLS
description: This provider enables streaming media using the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol.
---

This provider is used to embed streamable video content into documents using the
native `<video>` element, and supports streaming media using the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol.
The provider will prefer using [`hls.js`][hlsjs] over the native engine when supported to enable a
consistent and configurable experience across vendors. It works anywhere
[Media Source Extensions][can-i-mse] (MSE) or [Managed Media Source][can-i-mms] (MMS) is supported.

:::info
Refer to the [Player component][player] if you're looking for props, methods, and events.

## Install

You'll need to install [`hls.js`][hlsjs] if you're using the provider locally (i.e., not over a CDN):

::code[./install]{copy=true}

## Source

You can set a HLS source on the player like so:

::code[./source]

### Source Types

The HLS source URL should include the `.m3u8` file extension.

If the source URL **does not** contain a file extension, you must provide one of the following
type hints: **application/vnd.apple.mpegurl, audio/mpegurl, audio/x-mpegurl, application/x-mpegurl,
video/x-mpegurl, video/mpegurl, application/mpegurl.**

:::yes
The following are valid as they have a file extension or type hint:
:::

- `src="https://example.com/hls.m3u8"`
- `src = { src: "https://example.com/hls", type: "application/x-mpegurl" }`

### Client Playlist

You can create HLS playlists client-side like so:

::code[./client-playlist]

## Loading

The provider will default to loading `hls.js` from [JSDelivr][jsdelivr]. We load the default
bundle in development, and the minified version in production:

::code[./loading]

:::info
You can point library at any URL that re-exports `hls.js@^1.0`. This means you can use your own
server or CDN if desired.
:::

[jsdelivr]: https://www.jsdelivr.com

### Importing

You can also load `hls.js` by statically, or dynamically importing it and setting the `library`
property on the provider like so:

::code[./importing]

### Load Events

Regardless how you decide to load `hls.js` (NPM/CDN), the provider will fire the following
events on the [player][player] while loading the library:

::code[./load-events]

## Configuring

You can configure `hls.js` using the `config` property on the provider like so:

::code[./configure]

:::info
See the [`hls.js fine tuning`][hls-fine-tuning] guide on how to configure the library.

### Custom Headers

You can set custom request headers by using the `xhrSetup` configuration option. The following
snippet shows how to set the `Authorization` header:

::code[./custom-headers]

## Instance

You can obtain a reference to the `hls.js` instance like so:

::code[./instance]

## Events

All [hls.js events][hlsjs-events] can be listened to directly off the [player][player] component:

::code[./events]

import Events from '~/layouts/parts/api-table/events.astro';

<Events component="MediaPlayer" filter={({ name }) => /^(onHls|hls-)/i.test(name)} />

### Event Types

All HLS event types are prefixed with `HLS` and end with `Event` like so:

::code[./event-types]

[player-events]: /docs/player/components/core/player#mediaplayer.callbacks
[hlsjs-events]: https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/blob/master/docs/API.md#runtime-events

## Element

You can obtain a reference to the underlying `HTMLVideoElement` element like so:

::code[./element]

### Event Target

The `HTMLVideoElement` can also be referenced on all media events like so:

::code[./event-target]
