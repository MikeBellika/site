title: DASH
description: This provider enables streaming media using Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) protocol.
---

This provider is used to embed streamable video content into documents using the
native `<video>` element, and supports streaming media using the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
HTTP (DASH) protocol. The provider will use [`dash.js`][dashjs] to add support for DASH as
it's not supported natively in any browser. It works anywhere [Media Source Extensions][can-i-mse]
(MSE) or [Managed Media Source][can-i-mms] (MMS) is supported.

:::info
Refer to the [Player component][player] if you're looking for props, methods, and events.

## Install

You'll need to install [`dash.js`][dashjs] if you're using the provider locally (i.e., not
over a CDN):

::code[./install]{copy=true}

# Source

You can set a DASH source on the player like so:

::code[./source]

### Source Types

The DASH source URL should include the `.mpd` file extension.

If the source URL **does not** contain a file extension, you must provide the **application/dash+xml**
type hint.

:::yes
The following are valid as they have a file extension or type hint:
:::

- `src="https://example.com/dash.mpd"`
- `src = { src: "https://example.com/dash", type: "application/dash+xml" }`

## Loading

The provider will default to loading `dashjs` from [JSDelivr][jsdelivr]. We load the default
bundle in development, and the minified version in production:

::code[./loading]

:::info
You can point library at any URL that re-exports `dashjs@^4.0`. This means you can use your own
server or CDN if desired.
:::

[jsdelivr]: https://www.jsdelivr.com

### Importing

You can also load `dashjs` by statically, or dynamically importing it and setting the `library`
property on the provider like so:

::code[./importing]

### Load Events

Regardless how you decide to load `dashjs` (NPM/CDN), the provider will fire the following
events on the [player][player] while loading the library:

::code[./load-events]

## Configuring

You can configure `dashjs` using the `config` property on the provider like so:

::code[./configure]

## Instance

You can obtain a reference to the `dashjs` instance like so:

::code[./instance]

## Events

All dashjs events can be listened to directly off the [player][player] component:

::code[./events]

All DASH event types are prefixed with `DASH` and end with `Event` like so:

::code[./event-types]

:::info
You can find a complete list of [player events][player-events] in the component API reference.

## Element

You can obtain a reference to the underlying `HTMLVideoElement` element like so:

::code[./element]

### Event Target

The `HTMLVideoElement` can also be referenced on all media events like so:

::code[./event-target]
