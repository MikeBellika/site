This provider adds support for playing media on a remote device such as a TV using the
[Google Cast framework][google-cast]. This provider is automatically lazy loaded when a cast
receiver is selected by the user. See the [Remote Playback API][remote-playback] for
more information on how to request and track changes.

## Configure

The `googleCast` player property can be used to configure the receiver application ID like so:

::code[./configure]

You can further configure the cast context, session, media, and player in the provider setup hook
like so:

::code[./usage]

[remote-playback]: /docs/player/api/remote-playback
[media-provider]: /docs/player/components/core/provider

## Error Handling

You can listen for and handle Google Cast prompt errors like so:

::code[./errors]

### No Devices

If there are no devices available, a [toast is shown][toast-preview] at the top of the screen to
avoid opening an empty prompt. You can prevent showing the toast and display your own message like so:

::code[./prevent-toast]

## Active Screen

When Google Cast is active (i.e., connected to a receiver), a black screen is displayed inside
the [`MediaProvider`][media-provider] with the Google Cast logo and the name of the connected device.

<img
  src={googleCastImage.src}
  alt="Centered display of a logo with the text 'Google Cast on Lounge Room' below it."

  loading="lazy"
