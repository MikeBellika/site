description: An overview on requesting and tracking audio gain changes.
---

## Requesting

The player will use the [`GainNode`][gain-node] interface on the `HTMLMediaElement` to apply a
gain to audio output. The gain value is a float that represents the amount of gain to apply. The
default is `1`, setting it to `1.5` will increase volume by `50%`, `2` will increase volume by
`100%`, and so on.

You can request audio gain changes by using the [audio gain slider][gain-slider],
[remote control](#remote-control), or via [methods](#methods) on the player instance.
