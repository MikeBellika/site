description: An overview of using and configuring video playback quality.

## Loading

The [Loading Video Qualities][loading-qualities] guide covers how to create multiple resolutions
and why you should consider adaptive streaming protocols such as HLS or DASH. However, you can also
load different resolutions using multiple video files, see [Source Sizes][source-sizes].

## Quality List

The read-only `qualities` property on the player returns a `VideoQualityList` object that
contains `VideoQuality` objects. Each video quality represents a currently available
video rendition.

Similar to text tracks or audio tracks, the returned list is live; that is, as qualities are
added to and removed from the player, the list's contents change dynamically. Once you have a
reference to the list, you can monitor it for changes to detect when new qualities are added
or existing ones are removed by listening to [list events](#list-events).

::code[./quality-list]

The `VideoQuality` interface contains the following shape:

::code[./video-quality]

### Selecting

The `selected` property can be used to set the current video quality like so:

::code[./select]

Once set, the underlying provider will update the playback quality setting. Two things to keep
in mind is: (1) if the list is read only, setting selected will do nothing (use `qualities.readonly`
to check), and (2) if the list not read only, setting selected will remove auto quality selection.

### Switch

The quality switching behavior can be configured using the switch property on the
`VideoQualityList` object. The following options are available:

- `current` (default): Trigger an immediate quality level switch. This will abort the current
  fragment request if any, flush the whole buffer, and fetch fragment matching with current position
  and requested quality level.
- `next`: Trigger a quality level switch for next fragment. This could eventually flush already
  buffered next fragment.
- `load`: Set quality level for next loaded fragment.

::code[./switch]

### Auto Select

You can request the engine to handle automatic quality selection using the `autoSelect` method
on the `VideoQualityList` object like so:

::code[./auto-select]

Keep in mind, manually setting qualities will disable auto selection, you will need to
call `autoSelect()` to enable it again.

### List Events

The `VideoQualityList` object is an [`EventTarget`][event-target] which dispatches the
following events:

- `add`: Fired when a video quality has been added to the list.
- `remove`: Fired when a video quality has been removed from the list.
- `change`: Fired when the selected video quality changes.
- `auto-change`: Fired when the auto-quality selection mode changes.
- `readonly-change`: Fired when the read-only mode changes.

::code[./list-events]

## Media State

The following video quality properties are available on the media store:

- `qualities`: An array containing the current list of `VideoQuality[]` objects.
- `quality`: The current `VideoQuality` object or `null` if none is available.
- `autoQuality`: Whether automatic quality selection is enabled.
- `canSetQuality`: Whether qualities can be manually selected, in other words whether the
  quality list is not read-only.

::code[./state]

## Remote Control

The `changeQuality` method on the [media remote][media-remote] can be used to dispatch
`media-quality-change-request` request events to update the current video quality like so:

::code[./remote]

## Media Events

The following video quality events are available on the player:
