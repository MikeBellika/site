## Overview

Vidstack Player is designed around a request and response model, similar to the client-server model
or HTTP. State is stored as [signals][maverick-signals] and pushed down via context to consumers
such as UI components who subscribe to updates via effects, DOM events are dispatched up to
the player for requesting state changes, and the current media provider will asynchronously
respond to the request by satisfying or rejecting it.

<PlayerArchitectureDiagram />

Anything we "ask" the player (more precisely the current provider) to do is simply a
request as we can't guarantee success or failure, at least from the requestors perspective.
Requests are dispatched from child player components via DOM events to the `MediaRequestManager` which
performs the appropriate actions on the current media provider. The `MediaProviderAdapter` ensures we can
speak a common language across various providers as the API might differ. After the
`MediaRequestManager` performs it's tasks, a request is now pending and put into queue. The
media provider will asynchronously notify the `MediaStateManager` that the request was either satisfied
or rejected. Finally, the state manager will satisfy the request by attaching
it as a trigger to the media event (e.g., `media-play-request` will be attached to the media `play`
or `play-fail` event), release it from the queue, and update the media store. This completes
the request/response lifecycle. In the rest of this guide, we'll briefly unpack each of these
core architectural components and processes.

## Source Selection

[See source code][source-select].

The source selection process determines which [provider loader](#media-provider-loader) is
active and consequently which provider to load and render. The selection process is as follows:

1. Detect `src` attr or prop change.
2. Normalize `src` into an array of `Src` objects (`{src, type}`). If a source object is provided
   (e.g., `MediaStream` or `MediaSource`), the type will default to `video/object`, otherwise `unknown`.
3. The `sources-change` event is fired.
4. Walk through each source at a time in given order and attempt to find a provider who can play it.
   The `canPlay` method on each provider loader will check if the media extension or type can be played.
   The first loader to return true will be promoted to active.
5. The `source-change` event is fired. The current source will be `null` if no provider was matched.
6. Start the provider loading process.

## Media Provider Loader

See [interface][media-provider-loader] and [reference][media-provider-loader-ref].

Media provider loaders are responsible for determining whether the underlying provider can play a
given source, dynamically loading and initializing the provider, and rendering content inside
the media provider component. Rendered output includes `<audio>`, `<video>`, and `<iframe>` elements.

When a loader becomes active via the [source selection process](#source-selection), it will go
through the following setup process:

1. Destroy the old provider if no longer active and fire the `provider-change` event with detail
   set to `null`.
2. The loader will attempt to preconnect any URLs for the current provider or source.
3. The `provider-loader-change` event is fired.
4. Wait for the new media provider loader to render so the underlying element (e.g., `<video>`) is ready.
5. The loader will dynamically import and initialize the provider instance.
6. The `provider-change` event is fired. This is the best time to configure the provider before it runs
   through setup.
7. Once the specified player loading strategy has resolved, the provider `setup` method is called.
   This step generally involves loading required libraries and attaching event listeners.
8. The `provider-setup` event is fired.
9. Finally, the `loadSource` method is called on the provider with the selected source.

If the provider has not changed during a source change, then the setup process will be skipped and
only the new source will be loaded (step 9).

## Media Provider

See [interface][media-provider-adapter] and [reference][media-provider-ref].

In general, media provider's are responsible for rendering the underlying media element or iframe,
determining the media and view types, loading sources, managing tracks, setting properties,
performing media requests, attaching event listeners, and notifying the [`MediaStateManager`](#media-state-manager)
of state changes. In addition, each provider will implement the `MediaProviderAdapter` interface to
ensure they have a consistent API.

[media-provider-ref]: https://github.com/vidstack/player/blob/main/packages/vidstack/src/providers/video/provider.ts

## Media Context

[See interface][media-context].

The media context is a singleton object passed down from each player instance to all consumers. It
contains important objects such as the player itself, [remote control](#media-remote-control) for
dispatching requests, player delegate for notifying the [state manager](#media-state-manager) of
updates, [media store](#media-store) for UI to subscribe to state changes, and the current media
provider.

[media-context]: https://github.com/vidstack/player/blob/main/packages/vidstack/src/core/api/media-context.ts

## Media Store

[See source code][media-state].

The media store is a collection of signals which store and track individual pieces of state. The
[`MediaStateManger`](#media-state-manager) is responsible for updating the store when the
[media provider](#media-provider) notifies it of any changes. Player components will
subscribe to media state via effects to handle rendering attributes, managing the DOM, and
performing operations.

Signals are way for us to create reactive observables to store state, create computed properties,
and subscribe to updates as its value changes via effects. We created our own signals library called
[Maverick Signals][maverick-signals] which handles the scoping and reactivity complexity. See the
link for more information, and you can also read about [the evolution of signals by Ryan Carniato][evolution-of-signals]
if you'd like to dive deeper.

## UI Components

See example: [Base Component][play-button], [Custom Element][play-button-element], and [React Component][play-button-react].

UI components are abstracted to avoid rewriting complex logic across Custom Elements and React.
They're built on top of our component library called [Maverick][maverick]. Thanks to Signals
being our reactivie primitive of choice, we can adapt reactivity to work with any framework easily.
The component lifecycle has been simplified down to `onSetup` (initial setup),
`onAttach` (attached to a DOM or server element), `onConnect` (connected to the DOM), and
`onDestroy` (end of life). These lifecycle hooks are pure as they can run more than once in React,
and they can be individually disposed of.

The base component defines the general contract for the component across props, state, and events.
They have no rendered UI out of the box and are responsible for: accessibility, setting data attributes
and CSS variables for styling purposes, managing props and internal state, subscribing to media
state via the [media context](#media-context), attaching DOM event listeners, dispatching DOM
events, and exposing methods.

The mixin `Host(Component, HTMLElement)` is used to create a Custom Element and attach the base
component to it, and `createReactComponent(Component)` is used to create a client/server React
Component and attach to it.

## Media Remote Control

[See source code][media-remote-control].

The `MediaRemoteControl` is a simple facade for dispatching [media request events][media-request-events]
to the nearest player component in the DOM. It helps consumers avoid creating and dispatching an
event such as `el.dispatchEvent(new DOMEvent('media-play-request'))`, and instead just
call `remote.play()`.

[media-request-events]: https://github.com/vidstack/player/blob/main/packages/vidstack/src/core/api/media-request-events.ts

## Media Request Manager

[See source code][media-request-manager].

The `MediaRequestManager` routes [media request events][media-request-events] to the current media
provider by calling the appropriate actions on it. In addition, it queues the request event so the
[`MediaStateManager`](#media-state-manager) can satisfy it by attaching it to the correct [media event][media-events].
Important to note, the manager can speak with any provider because of the [`MediaProviderAdapter`](#media-provider)
interface. The interface ensures each provider has the same API for performing operations such as
play, pause, seek, etc.

[media-request-manager]: https://github.com/vidstack/player/blob/main/packages/vidstack/src/core/state/media-request-manager.ts

## Media State Manager

[See source code][media-state-manager].

The `MediaStateManager` is responsible for handling media state changes as they're delegated
from the [media provider](#media-provider) to it, satisfying [media request events][media-request-events]
by attaching them as triggers on the respective success/failure media event and releasing them from
the queue, dispatching [media events][media-events], and updating the media store to ensure it's
in-sync with the currently playing media and provider.
