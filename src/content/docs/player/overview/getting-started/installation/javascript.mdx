## 7. Create Player

<JSPlayer client:load />

The first argument to `VidstackPlayer.create` is a target element which can be a CSS string
selector or a `HTMLElement`. The target can be any element but if it's a `<audio>`, `<video>`,
or `<iframe>` element it will be replaced and enhanced (i.e., progressive enhancement).

::code[./target-container]

<JSTarget client:visible />

Props can also be set on the target element using data attributes like so:

::code[./data-attrs]

<IfLayout name="plyr-layout" client:load>

:::info
If you're coming over from [Plyr][plyr] and want a softer migration path, you can consider using our
Plyr constructor which has about ~95% of the same features and API:

<JSPlayer plyr client:load />

See the Plyr GitHub repo for docs and usage. Do note, in general this API is more limited and
doesn't have easy access to all player features. We strongly recommend upgrading to the newer API
above.

</IfLayout>
